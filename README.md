Wordpress 3.5 image uploader for custom use
=========

Hi everyone,
    This is my new experiment. Just create a customized form of wordpress 3.5 image uploader. You can use this in your
wordpress theme or plugin.

For Demo follow the steps:

1. Just create a wordpress page in wordpress named "Test" and its slug should be test.
2. Upload the file page-test.php in to your theme folder.
3. Run the page in your browser.

You can customize this code and can use any where.
